## Overview

Welcome to **GuerillaGenics** — the only DFS analytics platform where the jungle isn’t just a metaphor, it’s a way of life. We blend cutting-edge tech with primal instincts, delivering satirical, savage, and surprisingly sharp fantasy football insights. If you’re tired of the same old spreadsheets, it’s time to swing into the wild.

---

## Features

- **BioBoost Scores**: Unleash the beast within your lineups with our proprietary player bio analytics.
- **Defense Quadrant Badges**: Visualize matchups with quadrant-based defense heatmaps — because not all jungles are created equal.
- **Usage Stability Score**: Track which players are swinging from vine to vine, and which are rooted in opportunity.
- **Weekly Picks JSON Ingestion**: Feed the beast — ingest weekly picks and props with a single click.
