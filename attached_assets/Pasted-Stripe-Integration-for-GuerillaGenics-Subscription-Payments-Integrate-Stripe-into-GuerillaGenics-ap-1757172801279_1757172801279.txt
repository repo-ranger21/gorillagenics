Stripe Integration for GuerillaGenics Subscription Payments

Integrate Stripe into GuerillaGenics.app to enable secure subscription payments for unlocking premium features such as Weekly Picks, Top 5 DFS Picks, and Juice Watch alerts. The integration must support a $10/month recurring subscription, include branded frontend components, and be extensible for future contributor payouts via Stripe Connect.

üéØ Core Requirements

1. **Stripe Setup**
   - Use Stripe‚Äôs Checkout API for subscription payments.
   - Product: ‚ÄúJungle Access‚Äù ‚Äî $10/month recurring.
   - Store Stripe keys securely:
     - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in backend `.env`
     - `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in frontend `.env`

2. **Backend (Node.js + Express)**
   - Install Stripe SDK: `npm install stripe`
   - Create endpoint: `POST /api/create-checkout-session`
     - Mode: `subscription`
     - Line item: Jungle Access price ID
     - Success URL: `https://guerillagenics.app/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`
     - Cancel URL: `https://guerillagenics.app/cancel`
   - Optional: Add webhook endpoint `/api/webhook` to listen for:
     - `checkout.session.completed`
     - `customer.subscription.updated`
     - Update user access status in database

3. **Frontend (React + TailwindCSS)**

     - Redirect to Stripe-hosted checkout page
   - Add button to:
     - `UnlockBanner.jsx`
     - `FreePickModal.jsx`

6. **Branding**
- Button text: ‚ÄúUnlock Full Jungle Access ü¶ç‚Äù
- Modal copy: ‚ÄúYour first pick‚Äôs on the house. Subscribe for full jungle access.‚Äù

7. **Extensibility**
- Prepare backend for Stripe Connect integration:
  - Contributor onboarding via Express accounts
  - Referral payouts or pick-based earnings
- Add placeholder route: `POST /api/connect/onboard`
