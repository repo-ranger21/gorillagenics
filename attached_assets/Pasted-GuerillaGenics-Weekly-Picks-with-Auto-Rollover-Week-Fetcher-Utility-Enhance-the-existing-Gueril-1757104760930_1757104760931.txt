GuerillaGenics “Weekly Picks” with Auto‑Rollover + Week Fetcher Utility

Enhance the existing GuerillaGenics web app (https://guerillagenics.app/) by adding a new “Weekly Picks” feature that displays GuerillaGenics’ proprietary NFL picks for the current week, starting with the 2025–26 Week 1 slate, and automatically updates to the next week’s matchups every Tuesday. Include a `weekFetcher.js` utility to handle schedule API calls, rollover logic, and merging BioBoost picks.

🎯 **Core Requirements**

1. **Navigation & Access**
   - Add a “Weekly Picks” link/button to main navigation or dashboard.
   - Route: `/weekly-picks`
   - Clicking loads a dedicated page with current week’s matchups, BioBoost scores, and predicted winners.

2. **Weekly Picks Page Layout**
   - **Header:** “GuerillaGenics — Weekly Picks” + tagline “Bet Smarter. Go Primal.”
   - **Week Selector:** Dropdown or arrows to navigate between NFL weeks (default to current week).
   - **Matchup Cards/Table:** For each game:
     - Date & Time (ET)
     - Teams (away @ home)
     - Point Spread
     - Over/Under total
     - GuerillaGenics **BioBoost Score** (0–100)
     - Predicted Winner (highlighted with mascot emoji)
     - Short satirical commentary
   - **Filters:** All games | Thursday | Friday | Sunday Early | Sunday Late | SNF | MNF
   - **Live Odds Updates:** Simulate via mock WebSocket feed
   - **Newsletter CTA:** $10/month Substack signup in sidebar
   - **Disclaimer:** Persistent responsible betting notice

3. **Week 1 Data (Pre‑loaded)**
   - Use the GuerillaGenics Week 1 picks and BioBoost scores provided earlier as static defaults.

4. **BioBoost Calculation**
   - Include `bioBoostCalculator.js` utility to compute scores from:
     - Injury status
     - Weather impact
     - Line movement
     - Rest/travel factors
   - For Week 1, use provided static scores.

5. **Automation: Weekly Rollover**
   - Integrate with a public NFL schedule API (e.g., MySportsFeeds, TheSportsDB, or similar).
   - On page load:
     - Determine current NFL week based on today’s date.
     - If Tuesday 12:00 AM ET or later, switch to next week’s matchups.
     - Fetch matchups for that week from API.
     - Merge in GuerillaGenics BioBoost picks if available; otherwise, mark as “TBD.”
   - Cache last‑fetched week in localStorage to reduce API calls.
   - Allow manual override via Week Selector.

6. **Branded Loading & Fallback**
   - Show gorilla mascot animation with “🦍 Peeling the data bananas…” while loading.
   - If API fails, show last‑known cached picks or “Data is swinging in late — check back soon!” + newsletter signup.

🧮 **`weekFetcher.js` Utility Logic**
```js
// src/utils/weekFetcher.js
export async function getCurrentWeekData({ apiKey, baseUrl, staticWeek1 }) {
  const today = new Date();
  const currentDay = today.getUTCDay(); // 0=Sun, 1=Mon...
  const currentHour = today.getUTCHours();

  // Determine NFL week number (simplified: adjust based on season start date)
  const seasonStart = new Date(Date.UTC(2025, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0)); // Sept 4, 2025
  const daysSinceStart = Math.floor((today - seasonStart) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
  let weekNumber = Math.floor(daysSinceStart / 7) + 1;

  // Auto-rollover on Tuesday 12:00 AM ET
  const isTuesdayOrLater = (currentDay > 2) || (currentDay === 2 && currentHour >= 4);
  if (isTuesdayOrLater) weekNumber += 1;

  // Week 1 fallback
  if (weekNumber <= 1) return staticWeek1;

  try {
    const res = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/nfl/2025/week/${weekNumber}`, {
      headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` }
    });
    if (!res.ok) throw new Error("API error");
    const data = await res.json();
    return data.matchups.map(m => ({
      date: m.date,
      time: m.time,
      away: m.awayTeam,
      home: m.homeTeam,
      spread: m.spread,
      total: m.overUnder,
      bioBoost: null, // placeholder until computed
      pick: null
    }));
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Week fetch failed", err);
    return staticWeek1; // fallback to Week 1 data
  }
}
