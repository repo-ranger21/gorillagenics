GuerillaGenics “Weekly Picks” with Auto‑Rollover

Enhance the existing GuerillaGenics web app (https://guerillagenics.app/) by adding a new “Weekly Picks” feature that displays GuerillaGenics’ proprietary NFL picks for the current week, starting with the 2025–26 Week 1 slate, and automatically updates to the next week’s matchups every Tuesday.

🎯 **Core Requirements**

1. **Navigation & Access**
   - Add a new button or link labeled “Weekly Picks” to the main navigation or dashboard.
   - Route: `/weekly-picks`
   - Clicking “Weekly Picks” loads a dedicated page with the current week’s matchups, BioBoost scores, and predicted winners.

2. **Weekly Picks Page Layout**
   - **Header:** “GuerillaGenics — Weekly Picks” with sub‑tagline “Bet Smarter. Go Primal.”
   - **Week Selector:** Dropdown or arrows to navigate between NFL weeks (default to current week).
   - **Matchup Cards/Table:** For each game:
     - Date & Time (ET)
     - Teams (away @ home)
     - Point Spread
     - Over/Under total
     - GuerillaGenics **BioBoost Score** (0–100)
     - Predicted Winner (highlighted with mascot emoji)
     - Short satirical commentary
   - **Filters:** All games | Thursday | Friday | Sunday Early | Sunday Late | SNF | MNF

4. **BioBoost Calculation**
   - Include `bioBoostCalculator.js` utility to dynamically compute scores from:
     - Injury status
     - Weather impact
     - Line movement
     - Rest/travel factors
   - For Week 1, use the provided scores as static values.

5. **Automation: Weekly Rollover**
   - Integrate with a public NFL schedule API (e.g., MySportsFeeds, TheSportsDB, or similar).
   - On page load:
     - Determine current NFL week based on today’s date.
     - Fetch matchups for that week from the API.
     - If it’s Tuesday 12:00 AM ET or later, automatically switch to the next week’s matchups.
   - Store last‑fetched week in localStorage to avoid unnecessary API calls.
   - Allow manual override via Week Selector.

6. **Branded Loading & Fallback**
   - Show gorilla mascot animation with “🦍 Peeling the data bananas…” while loading.
   - If API fails, show last‑known cached picks or “Data is swinging in late — check back soon!” + newsletter signup.
