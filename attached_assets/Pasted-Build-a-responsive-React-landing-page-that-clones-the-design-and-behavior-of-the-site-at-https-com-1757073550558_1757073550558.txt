Build a responsive React landing page that clones the design and behavior of the site at https://comma-khaki-02307315.figma.site/. Match the layout, animations, color palette, and mascot-driven branding exactly.

Design Requirements:
- Use TailwindCSS for styling
- Match the jungle-themed color palette: deep greens, banana yellows, and primal reds
- Use the same typography hierarchy and spacing as the Figma site
- Import and display the Over/Under Ape mascot image from the original site
- Include animated transitions for:
  - Section reveals (fade-in, slide-up)
  - BioBoost score changes (pulse or bounce)
  - Juice Watch alerts (gorilla shake or flash)
- Use SVG or Unsplash-hosted images from the original site where applicable

Page Sections:
1. **Hero Section**
   - Title: ‚ÄúBet Smarter. Go Primal.‚Äù
   - CTA Button: ‚ÄúEnter the Jungle‚Äù
   - Background image or gradient matching the Figma site

2. **BioMetric Intelligence**
   - Cards for each metric: Testosterone Index, Sleep Score, Cortisol Proxy, Hydration Level, Injury Recovery Timeline
   - Include BioBoost scores and historical impact stats
   - Use animated progress bars or score meters

3. **Primate Picks**
   - Display featured players (e.g., Josh Allen, CeeDee Lamb, Saquon Barkley)
   - Show stat lines, BioBoost scores, and betting recommendations
   - Include mascot reaction emoji and confidence percentage

4. **Juice Watch Alerts**
   - Live feed of metric spikes
   - Alert configuration toggles: Zen Gorilla, Alpha Ape, Full Bananas
   - Include animated gorilla reactions and alert summaries

5. **Footer**
   - Jungle-themed newsletter signup
   - Links to ethics, transparency, and responsible gaming
   - Satirical disclaimer: ‚ÄúMade with ü¶ç in the jungle‚Äù

Technical Requirements:
- Use React functional components
- Use Framer Motion or Tailwind transitions for animations
