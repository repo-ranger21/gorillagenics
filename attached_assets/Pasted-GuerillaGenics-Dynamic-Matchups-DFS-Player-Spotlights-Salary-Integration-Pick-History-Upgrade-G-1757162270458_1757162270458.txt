---

üéØ Core Goals

1. **Replace Static Matchups with Live Schedule Integration**
   - Integrate a live NFL schedule API:
     - Primary: [ESPN JSON feed or scoreboard endpoint]
     - Secondary: [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/liveapi/guides/v4/) for matchup + odds data
   - Auto-detect current NFL week based on UTC date.
   - Auto-rollover to next week‚Äôs slate every Tuesday at 12:00 AM ET.
   - Cache schedule data for 15 minutes; fallback to last-known cache if API fails.

2. **Add Offensive Player Spotlights per Matchup**
   - For each matchup, display 2‚Äì4 featured offensive players per team:
     - Positions: QB, RB, WR, TE only.
     - Data sources:
       - Primary: Sleeper API (player meta, team, position, status)
       - Secondary: SportsData.io (if available)
     - Include:
       - Headshot image
       - Role tag (QB1, WR1, RB1, TE1)
       - Usage notes (e.g., target share, carry share, red zone usage)
       - DFS value indicator (based on salary vs projection)
   - Filter out any player with defensive or special teams positions.

3. **Integrate DFS Salary Context**
   - Pull DraftKings and FanDuel salary data for featured players:
     - Use public CSV feeds or partner APIs if available.
     - Normalize salaries to show value tiers: Elite, Mid, Sleeper.
   - Add ‚ÄúSlate Eligibility‚Äù badges:
     - Main Slate (Sunday 1pm‚Äì4pm)
     - Prime-Time (SNF, MNF, TNF)
     - Showdown (single-game slates)
   - Display salary next to player name with color-coded value badge.

4. **Add Pick History and Accuracy Tracking**
   - Create a `/past-picks` page with:
     - Weekly archive of all matchups and GuerillaGenics picks.
     - Outcome tracking: Win/Loss, Over/Under result.
     - BioBoost score and confidence band per pick.
     - Accuracy metrics:
       - Overall pick accuracy (%)
       - Over/Under hit rate
       - BioBoost prediction success rate
       - Contributor trust score (if multi-user)
   - Add filters: by week, team, result, confidence band.
   - Cache historical data in localStorage and backend DB.
