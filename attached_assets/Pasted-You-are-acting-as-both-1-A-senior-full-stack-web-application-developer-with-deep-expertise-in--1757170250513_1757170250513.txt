**Your task:**
Perform a **deep, comprehensive analysis** of the *entire code workspace* for the GuerillaGenics project. This includes **every file** in the repository — frontend, backend, utilities, configuration, and assets.

For each file:
- **Summarize its purpose** and how it fits into the overall app.
- **Identify any bugs, errors, or anti‑patterns** in the code.
- **Point out missing error handling, validation, or security measures**.
- **Check API integrations** for correctness, efficiency, and resilience.
- **Verify DFS/NFL betting logic** for accuracy, compliance, and edge‑case handling.
- **Evaluate performance**: hydration, caching, CLS, lazy loading, and asset preloading.
- **Assess code style and maintainability**: naming conventions, modularity, DRY principles.
- **Check SEO and accessibility**: meta tags, semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, structured data.
- **Review environment variable usage** for security and flexibility.
- **Ensure cooperation between frontend and backend**: consistent data contracts, error formats, and state updates.

**Deliverables:**
1. **File‑by‑file review**:
   - Purpose
   - Issues found
   - Recommended corrections or refactors
   - Example code snippets for fixes (if needed)

2. **Cross‑cutting recommendations**:
   - Architectural improvements
   - Performance optimizations
   - UX/UI enhancements
   - DFS/betting‑specific feature improvements
   - Security and compliance updates

3. **Prioritized action list**:
   - High‑priority fixes (bugs, security, compliance)
   - Medium‑priority improvements (performance, maintainability)
   - Low‑priority polish (style, minor UX tweaks)

---

**Important:**
- Be exhaustive — do not skip any file.
- Be specific — point to exact lines or patterns that need attention.
- Be practical — suggest changes that are realistic to implement.
- Keep all recommendations aligned with GuerillaGenics’ brand and goals:
  - Jungle‑themed, contributor‑first NFL DFS prediction platform
  - Transparent, ethical, and fun sports betting experience
